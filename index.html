Hii Shreya ❤️
This is one of the last love messages I’ll ever write for you…

Your love and innocence were the purest thing I ever experienced. I’m truly grateful to God that I got a chance to feel your love once in my life.

You deserve every happiness, every dream, and any partner your beautiful soul chooses. You’re already so mature… a true goddess of love. And maybe it was right that you left me. You never deserved a weak, insecure, problem-giving man like me. Your soul deserved someone better.

The pain I feel now… maybe it was written in my destiny, and I accept it.
Thank you for making me feel special in ways no one else ever has. You were the closest I’ve ever come to seeing God in a human.

On your birthday, I just pray for your success, peace, and happiness.
I’m letting you go completely… detaching everything from my side… and accepting whatever destiny brings.

I know we can’t be together again, but in my heart we’ll always be connected forever.

HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO YOU ❤️
Keep smiling always.

— your (nothing)
